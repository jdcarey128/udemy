AWS Cloud Practioner exam: CLF-C01

Section 3: What is Cloud Computing? 

What is in a server? 
- CPU: Computation
- RAM: Memory
- CPU + RAM = Brain of Computer
- Storage: Data 
  - Stored in a more structured way = database
- Network: Routers, switch, DNS server 

IT Terminology:
- network: cables, routesr and servers connetec with each other 
- router: a networking device that forwards data packets between computers within networks. 
- switch: send packet of data to the correct client on your network

Cloud computing: on demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources
- pay as you go pricing (pay for only what you use)
- provision exactly the right size and type of computing resources you need
- access as many resources as you need, instantly 
- easily accessible interface

Private cloud: private data center not exposed to the public
- eg. Rackspace

Public cloud: owned and operated by third party service provider
- eg. Azure, Google Cloud, AWS

Hybrid cloud: mix of private and public
- control of sensitive assets that is provided by private cloud 
- accessibility of public cloud 

Five characteristics of cloud computing: 
1) on demand self-service 
2) broad network access 
3) multi-tenancy and resource pooling 
- customers can share same infrastructure and applications 
4) rapid elsaticity and scalability 
- quickly and easily scale based on demand 
5) measured service 
- usage is measured and you pay for what you use 

6 Advantages: 
1) Trade capital expense for operational expense 
2) benefit from massive economies of scale 
3) stop guessing capacity (auto scaling)
4) increase speed and agility
5) stop spending money running and maintaining data centers 
6) go global in minutes 


Types of cloud computing: 
1) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- providing networking, computers, data storage 
- migrate from traditional on site IT to cloud 
- eg. EC2
2) Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Remove need for organization to manage the underlying infrastructure 
- focus on the deployment and management of your applications 
3) Software as a Service (Saas)
- Completed product that is going to be run and managed by service provider 

Comparison between service responsibilities: 
Traditional on-premise: applications, data, runtime, middleware, O/S, virtualization, servers, storage, networking
IaaS: applications, runtime, middleware, O/S 
- eg. EC2 (AWS)
PaaS: applications, data 
- eg. Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku 
Saas: everything is managed by AWS 
eg. Rekognition, Gmail, Dropbox 

AWS regions: 
- all over the world 
- contains code 
- cluster of data centers 
- most services are linked/scoped to region 
- consist of isolated, physically distant availability zones 

How do you choose an AWS region? 
- compliance: data never leaves a region without your explicit permission 
- proximity: depending on where most users are located, will likely choose nearby region (reduce latency, aka lag in application)
- available services: regions may not have every service available
- pricing: pricing varies from region to region 

Availability zones: 
- each region has several Availability zones (from 2 to 6)
- each availability zone is one or more discrete data center with redundant power, networking, and connectivity (protects against loss)


The shared responsibility model: defines the distribution of responsibilites for security in the AWS cloud
